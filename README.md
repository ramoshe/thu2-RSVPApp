## Buggy RSVP App - Alternate Version
Below are a list of bugs in this app:
* Checking the box to hide unconfirmed guests hides confirmed guests. Unconfirmed guests stay visible. Unchecking the confirmed box unhides confirmed guests.
* Submitting new names to the list results in guests named "span" rather than the name submitted. Also, the new list item's children all have the wrong names.
* Clicking "Save" when editing a guest's name does not work.
* Clicking a remove button makes the button itself disappear.
* Checking a box to confirm an individual guest doesn't highlight the list item.

*Note that fixing the bugs listed here may uncover other bugs that need attention. See if you can find and fix those bugs too!*
